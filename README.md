## Class Meetings

It is my hope to teach the class in person. However, too many students walk the halls without masks or improperly wearing masks (which is the same as not wearing them). I'll give it a couple of days, if I pass too many selfish or clueless people in the halls, I will move the class online to [here](https://carthage-edu.zoom.us/j/96177856652?pwd=czdqUEk5UmVyMjRCbkd2L2hUcGV4dz09).

Given the high level of non-compliance on campus, you should consider the probability of going virtual to be *high*.

## Syllabus

## My Assembly Language Book

My book is a work in progress. It is located [here](https://github.com/CCCSBuffet/pk_do_not_be_afraid).

## Useful Links

[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention#ARM_(A64)) link is to Wikipedia explaining the ARM 64 Linux calling convention. Understanding the calling convention is critical to programming in assembly language.

Note that calling conventions are platform dependent. The ARM-based Mac, for example, uses a different calling convention. Why? Because Apple.

More useful resources are located [here](./reference).
